PENDULUMS
Disregard centrifugal force. Consider earth of uniform density. Consider the length of a seconds pendulum 39.1 in. ^ = 32.16.
1. What is the length of a pendulum that will beat 4 times in 3 seconds?
2. What is the length of a pendulum that beats (\emph{a}) l a second? (\emph{b}) ^ a second?
3. What is the length of a pendulum that vibrates 5 times in 4 seconds?
4. A clock having a seconds pendulum gains 2 minutes a day. How much too short is the pendulum?
6. A pendulum vibrates once a second and another 3 times in 2 seconds. What are their relative lengths?
6. How long must a pendulum be to make 3 vibrations while a pendulum 70 cm. long is making 2 vibrations?
7. If the times of vibration of 2 pendulums are as 2 : 3, what are their relative lengths?
8. A certain pendulum makes 3 vibrations while another makes 4. What are their relative lengths?
9. If a pendulum makes 5 vibrations while another is making 2, what are the relative lengths of the two pendulums?
10. What must be the relative lengths of two pendulums if one vibrates 3 times as fast as the other?
11. If a pendulum 2 m. long vibrates 42 times in a minute, what is the length of a pendulum that vibrates 84 times in a minute?
12. A clock whose pendulum beats ^ a second is found to gain 30 seconds a day in the winter. How much has the pendulum contracted?
13. The length of a pendulum being increased J, what is the ratio of decrease of vibrations in a given time?
14. If on account of a change in the length of a pendulum the number of vibrations in a given time has been increased J, what part of its length has the pendulum been shortened?
15. When two pendulums are hung side by side, one of them is found to make 5 more vibrations in 3 minutes than the other. If the first pendulum is 60 cm. long, how long is the other? The length of a seconds pendulum is 993.3 mm.
16. Find the length of a seconds pendulum at the poles ; ^1332.25.
17. In what time would a seconds pendulum vibrate when placed at a distance of 8000 miles above the surface of the earth?
18. If a seconds pendulum is placed at a distance of 2000 miles below the surface of the earth, what will be its time of vibration?
19. What will be the value of ^ in a place where a pendulum 39.2 in. long beats seconds?
20. How high must a balloon rise above the surface of the earth to cause a seconds pendulum which it carries to beat 58 times a minute?
21. A seconds pendulum on being carried to the top of a mountain is found to vibrate but 57 times in a minute. What is the acceleration of gravity at this point?
22. At the bottom of a mine in the latitude of New York a pendulum which at the surface beats seconds is found to make but 59 vibrations in a minute. What is the depth of the mine?
23. If the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the sun is 28 times as great as at the surface of the earth, what would be the length of a seconds pendulum there?
24. If the squares of the times of vibration at two points are inversely as the forces of gravity at those points, what is the relation between the times of vibration and the distances of the points of vibration from the center of the earth?
25. The diameter of the earth is 7900 and of the moon 2160 miles. The average density of the earth is 5.6 and of the moon 3.5. How long a time of vibration would a pendulum have on the moon if it vibrates once a second on the surface of the earth?
