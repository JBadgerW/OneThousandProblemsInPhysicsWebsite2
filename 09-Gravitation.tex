GRAVITATION
Disregard centrifugal force. Consider earth of uniform density.

2. How far above the surface of the earth will 1 lb. avoirdupois weigh 4 oz.? How far below?
3. How much would a mass that weighs 100 lbs. 1000 miles below the surface of the earth weigh 3000 miles above the surface?
4. What would a mass that weighs 1 lb. 2000 miles above the earth's surface weigh 2000 miles below the surface?
6. If a body weighs 20 lbs. on the surface of the earth, what will be its weight 1000 miles below the surface?
6. What ratio will the mass of a i-lb. weight, at a point 1000 miles from the center of the earth, bear to the mass needed to weigh 1 lb. at the surface of the earth?
7. If moon's diameter is J, and mass ^ that of earth, what is the weight of a Ib.-mass on the moon's surface?
8. Suppose the mass of the earth were increased i. How much would one of our present pound weights then weigh?
9. A mass of lo g. is loo cm. distant from another mass of 1 g. What ratio does the attraction of the lo-g. mass for the i-g. mass bear to that of the i-g. for the lo-g.?
10. How would it affect the attraction between the earth and moon to double the mass of both?
11. Suppose the distance of the moon were doubled, what effect would it have upon its attraction for the earth?
12. If the mass of the earth were doubled and that of the moon were trebled, how would this affect their attraction for each other?
13. If the volume of the sun should decrease ^y its mass remaining the same, what effect would this have upon its attraction for masses upon its surface?
14. Suppose the sun were 4 times as far away, how would this affect its attraction for the earth?
15. The mass of 1 lb. is carried to such a distance above the earth that it weighs but 1 5 oz. What is the acceleration due to gravity at this point? The acceleration on the surface is 32 ft. per second per second.
16. How far above the surface of the earth will 1 lb. avoirdupois weigh only 1 oz.? What is the acceleration due to gravity at this point?
17. If the diameter of the earth is 8000 miles, with what acceleration will a body 1200 miles above the surface of the earth tend to fall?
18. Jupiter has 316 times as much matter in it as the earth, and its diameter is 11 times that of the earth. A body on the earth falls with an acceleration of 32 ft. per second per second. What will be its acceleration per second on Jupiter?
19. Two balls, one weighing 5 lbs. and the other 8 lbs., are distant from a third 10 and 15 ft., respectively. What is their relative attraction for the third ball?
20. Two bodies which mutually attract each other have their masses increased 2 and 3 fold, respectively. How much must the distance between them be increased to keep their attraction for each other the same as it was before the masses were increased?
21. If the distance between two bodies is increased 3 fold, how much must the product of their masses be increased to keep their mutual attraction the same?
22. The relative masses of two bodies are as 2:3, and their relative distances from a third are as 4:5. What is their relative attraction for the third?
23. The attractions of two bodies for a third are as 3 : 4, and their masses as 2 : 3. What are their relative distances?
24. The attractions of two bodies for a third are as 3 : 8, and their distances as 4:3. What are their relative masses?
25. The mass of the earth is about 80 times that of the moon, and their distance apart is 240,000 miles. At what distance from the earth in the line joining their centers of gravity would a mass be equally attracted by each of these bodies?
26. If the mass of the earth is 80 times the mass of the moon, and the distance between them is 240,000 miles, what ratio will the attraction of the earth, for a body situated 120,000 miles from its center on a line joining the centers of gravity of the earth and moon, bear to the attraction of the moon for that body?
27. If g equals 32 ft. per second per second at the surface of the earth, what will it be at a point 40,000 miles from the surface of the earth?
28. If the earth and moon were to be drawn together by their mutual attraction, at what distance from the point at present occupied by the earth would the impact take place?
29. The diameters of the earth and moon are 7900 and 2160 miles, respectively. Their sp. grs. are 5.6 and 3.5, If a body upon the earth weighs 100 lbs., what would it weigh upon the moon?
30. The equatorial diameter of the earth is about 7925, and the polar diameter about 7900 miles. How much will a mass which, by the indication of a spring balance, weighs 1 ton at the equator, weigh at the pole ^
