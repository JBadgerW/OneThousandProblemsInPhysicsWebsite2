\section*{PREFACE}
An experience of some years in teaching physics in secondary schools has convinced the authors of the necessity of supplementing laboratory and lecture work with numerical problems.

The clarifying of pupils' ideas and the clenching of principles involved in laboratory exercises are believed to be materially furthered by the solution of suitable problems. The use of problems in physics gives also an opportunity for the review and practical application of the mathematics already studied.

Conversation with other teachers of physics has developed the fact that there is more or less widespread an opinion which coincides with that of the authors. The existence of this opinion and the need of a systematic collection of problems for our own classes furnish, in a measure, the \emph{raison d'etre} of this book.

Nearly all the problems have borne the test of class use and are, we believe, adapted to the needs of the secondary school pupil.
The collection has been made large in order that different problems may be used with different classes. Through the courtesy of the Department of Physics of Harvard College the entrance examinations for the past ten years have been inserted.

The manuscript has been read by Mr. George W. Towne of the Classical and High School, Salem, Mass.

The proof sheets have been read by Prof. Albert de Forest Palmer of Brown University and Mr. A. B. Kimball of the High School, Springfield, Mass.

Mr. Frederick H. Holmes of the Normal School, Hyannis, Mass., has made many valuable suggestions.

To the above-mentioned gentlemen we beg to express our sincere thanks.

The authors only are responsible for any errors which may appear.

\item A uniform cylinder 20 cm. long and 10 cm. in diameter is filled with water. Will the average pressure per sq. cm. on the inside of the cylinder be greater when the cylinder is lying on its side, or standing on one of its ends?
$$\mbox{\emph{Stiffness is proportional to }} \frac{(width)\ \times\ (thickness)^3}{(length)^3}$$
\item Find the pressure per sq. cm. in mercury of density 13.6 at the depth of 65 cm.

\item A box 10 cm. square and 15 cm. long is placed with its longest side vertical, and has a tube extending through the top to a vertical height of 20 cm. Both the box and tube are filled with water. What is the pressure (\emph{a}) on the top of the box? (\emph{b}) on the bottom? (\emph{c}) on one of the sides? 
\item A cubical box 10 cm. on a side is filled with mercury. What is the pressure (\emph{a}) on .the top of the box? (\emph{b}) on the bottom? (\emph{c}) on one of the sides?
\item A cubical box 12 cm. on a side is filled with mercury. What is the entire pressure on the box?
\item In the previous problem, the box has a tube 1 cm. square extending through a hole in the top, and rising vertically 10 cm. above the top of the box. The tube is filled with water. What is now the entire pressure on the box?
\item There is a cubical box 20 cm. on a side filled with water. In the top of the box is inserted a tube 4 cm. square and 15 cm. long. The tube is filled with oil of sp. gr. .75, which rests upon the water in the box. What is the pressure (\emph{a}) on the top of the box? (\emph{b}) on the bottom? (\emph{c}) on one of the sides?
