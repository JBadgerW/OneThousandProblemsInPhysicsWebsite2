<h1>DENSITY AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY</h1>
<ol>
<li><a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('02-001')">How would you find without the use of balances the weight of a wooden ball which, when placed in a tumbler full of water, causes an overflow of 100 c.c.?</a></li>
<div id="02-001" style="display:none; margin:0.5em; padding: 0.25em; border: 1px solid black"><em>Assumption: the wooden ball floats.</em> A floating body displaces an amount of water equal to its weight. 100 cc of water weighs 100 g, so the wooden ball also weighs 100 g. (<em>Nota bene:</em> Weight and mass are being used interchangeably here. That's not always a good assumption.)</div>
<li><a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('02-002')">A piece of aluminum weighs 200 g. in air and 100 g. in water, (<em>a</em>) What is its density in the French system? (<em>b</em>) in the English system? (<em>c</em>) its sp. gr. in the French system? (<em>d</em>) in the English system?</li>
<div id="02-002" style="display:none; margin:0.5em; padding: 0.25em; border: 1px solid black">The weight of the submerged aluminum is 100g less than in air, so it must be displacing 100g of water. The volume of 100g of water is 100 cc, so the volume of the aluminum must also be 100 cc, since it's completely submerged.<br />Mass of aluminum in air = 200g; volume = 100 cc. \[density=\frac{mass}{volume}\]Therefore, the density of the aluminum is \(\frac{\mathrm{2 g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3}\). (This is metric, i.e. the "French system".)<br />(<em>b</em>) Use unit multipliers to convert to English units, \(\frac{\mathrm{lb}}{\mathrm{in}^3}\):
\[\frac{2\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3}\times\left(\frac{2.54 \mathrm{cm}}{1 \mathrm{in}}\right)^3\times\frac{1 \mathrm{kg}}{1000 \mathrm{g}}\times\frac{2.2 \mathrm{lb}}{1 \mathrm{kg}}=0.0721\frac{\mathrm{lb}}{\mathrm{in}^3}\]<br />(<em>c</em>) A material's specific gravity is the ratio of its density to the density of water, so it will be the same no matter which system you use, since the units will always cancel. In this case: 2.<br />(<em>d</em>) The answer is evident above.
</div>
<li><a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('02-003')">What will be the volume of 280 g. of substance of sp. gr. 14?</li>
<div id="02-003" style="display:none; margin:0.5em; padding: 0.25em; border: 1px solid black">Specific gravity 14 means a density 14 times that of water: 14g/cc.\[volume=\frac{mass}{density}\]Therefore, \[\frac{280\mathrm{g}}{14\mathrm{g/cc}}=20\mathrm{cm}^3\]<br /><em>Nota bene:</em> I am using cc and \(\mathrm{cm}^3\) interchangeably. Deal with it.</div>
<li><a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('02-004')">A given substance weighs 800 g. in air and 600 g. in water. What is (<em>a</em>) its volume? (<em>b</em>) its sp. gr.? (<em>c</em>) its density in the C. G. S. system?</li>
<div id="02-004" style="display:none; margin:0.5em; padding: 0.25em; border: 1px solid black">(<em>a</em>) Difference in weight under water indicates a displacement of 200 g. This implies a volume of 200 cc.<br />(<em>b</em>) Density equals mass divided by volume, so density = 4 g/cc. This is 4 times water, so a sp. gr. of 4.<br />(<em>c</em>) I'm pretty sure the density in <em>b</em> is given in the C.G.S. (Centimeter-Gram-Second) system.</div>
<li><a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('02-005')">What will be the weight (<em>a</em>) of a cu. ft. of iron of sp. gr. 7? (<em>b</em>) of a c.c.?</li>
<div id="02-005" style="display:none; margin:0.5em; padding: 0.25em; border: 1px solid black">(<em>a</em>) If the sp. gr. of iron is 7, then its density is 7 times that of water: i.e. \(7\times\frac{1\mbox{ g}}{\mbox{cm}^3}=\frac{7\mbox{ g}}{\mbox{cm}^3}\). Convert \(\mbox{ft}^3\) into \(\mbox{cm}^3\) and multiply by the density in \(\frac{\mbox{g}}{\mbox{cm}^3}\) to get the weight/mass in grams:\[1\mbox{ ft}^3\times\left(\frac{12\mbox{ in}}{1\mbox{ ft}}\right)^3\times\left(\frac{2.54\mbox{ cm}}{1\mbox{ in}}\right)^3\times\frac{7\mbox{ g}}{\mbox{cm}^3}=198,000\mbox{ g}\]<br >(<em>a</em>) I already answered <em>b</em> in the process of answering <em>a</em>.</div>
