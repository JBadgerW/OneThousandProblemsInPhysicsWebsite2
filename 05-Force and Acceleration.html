<h1>FORCE AND ACCELERATION</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    <i>g</i> = 32 ft. per sec. per sec, or 980 cm. per sec. per sec.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
    Wherever the pound is used as a unit of force, unless otherwise stated, it is to be considered equal to 32 poundals; similarly, the gram force equals 980 dynes.
